# 3dbfm-mvm
# Controlled/living radical polymerization (CRP) is a widely used technique that allows the synthesis of defined polymer architectures through precise control of molecular weights and distributions. The preparation of a new 3D single cyclized polymer chain structure from an in situ deactivation enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization of multivinyl monomers (MVMs). This structure is fundamentally distinct from the definition of conventional dendritic/hyperbranched and cross-linked polymeric materials. However, The experimental measurement of the single cyclized structure is challenging. Computer simulation can provide important information on parameters which are not easily accessible experimentally. This progarm is envisioned to develop a new model to study the mechanism of ATRP of MVMs, especially the extent of intramolecular cyclization.
